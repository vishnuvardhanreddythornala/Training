52. Write a Java method clockProblem(int input1, int input2) that simulates a 12-hour analog clock.

	Problem Requirements
	input1 represents the current hour position on a clock (1–12).
	input2 represents the number of jumps/multiplication factor.
	Multiply input1 and input2 to calculate the movement.
	The clock should always stay within 1 to 12.
	If the calculated value exceeds 12, it should wrap around using clock logic.
	If the final calculated position becomes 0, it must be treated as 12.
	Test case 1 : 
	input1 = 3
	input2 = 4
	
	output is  12.
	Test case 2 : 
	input1 = 4
	input2 = 5
	
	output is 8.
	
	Test case 3:
	input1 = 9
	input2 = 7
	
	output is 3.

71. * write a java program to input a number and check and print weather it is an abundant number or not.
 * opt:
 * return 1 if it is abundant number
 * return 0 if it is not an abundant number
 * 
 * explanation
 *  an abundant factor is a number for which are sum of tits proper factors is grater than the number itself
 *  
 *  consider num 12
 *  factors 12 = 1,2,3,..6
 *  sum of factors = 1+2+
 *  as 16>12 so 12 is an abundant.
72.Write a program to Check Given Number is a Xylem or Phloem  Number. and return a suitable message.
Explanation:-
A number N will be a xylem number if the sum of its extreme (first and last) digits is equal to the sum of mean means digits present in the middle other than first and last digit(all digits except first and last) digits. If the sum of extreme digits is not equal to the sum of mean digits, the number is called phloem number.
Check Inner sum and Outer sum are the same or not. Both are the same return(String return type) 1 otherwise 0.
1 --> xylem number
0 --> phloem number


Example:-

         int num = 12341
         outer values = 1,1-----> add both 1+1=2 --->outer sum is 2.
         inner values = 2,3,4----->  add those 2+3+4 ----->inner sum is 9.
         compare both inner and outer 
         Both are not equal. So, return 0.
         if both are equal, So,return 1 .
73.program to determine wheather a given number is a disarium number.
A number is said to be the s=disarium number when the sum of its digit raised to the power of their respestive position is equal to the number itself.
ex: 175
1*1 +7*2 + 5*5
1+49+125 = 175
